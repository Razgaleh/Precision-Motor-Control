# Hf Rod Ablation Source Picomotor

Arduino-based Command Line Interface for Controlling the Rotation of the Hf Rod in the Ion Trap's Ablation Source

Here you can find the code to move a metal Rod (Hf) using an Arduino Motor. 

## 1 Ablation Source 

Here's how the ablation source for the ion trap used in eEDM experiment looks like, you can see the Hf rod here:
